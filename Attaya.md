==Implements==

* Small teapot (Short and stout)
* Two small, tall glass cups
* A plate

==Ingredients==

* Gunpowder Green Tea
* Mint leaves
* Sugar

==Instructions==

# Fill a small teapot to the bottom of the spout's inside opening with the tea.
# Add the leaves from three sprigs of mint to the teapot.
# Fill with water to the top of the spout's inside opening.
# Bring to a boil slowly.
# Pour the tea into a cup.
# Pour the tea from the cup into the other cup in a sweeping-up-the-down motion. A successful sweeping motion will make a layer of foam on top of the tea.
# Repeat 5-10 times, until you can't get more foam.
# Pour back into the pot along with an extra cup of water.
# Bring back to a boil.
# Pour sugar into one cup, filling it 4/5ths of the way.
# Pour the tea into the sugar-cup.
# Pour the sugar-cup into the other cup.
# Pour more tea into the sugar-cup, and pour the other cup back into the pot.
# Do this until the sugar is 3/4ths gone, then fill the sugar-cup halfway with water and pour that into the pot.
# Boil again.
# Repeat steps 5-7 but do it 10-20 times.
# Serve half a cup to each person.
# Repeat steps 3-17 two more times.
